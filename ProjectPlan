	•	Using github to constantly update where we are up to
	•	Create base together
	•	I think best if we try a few different approaches
	◦	ML sounds promising and extremely interesting
	•	However, from my tutor, some work really well, and others just fall in a heap and lose out on the 7 marks.
	•	From what I understand, won't be all that hard to implement.
	•	Have no prev data, so would have to use unsupervised learning
	•	Need a way to have it create an evaluation function
	•	Then use a 
	•	Devise a cutoff
 
	•	What we have to solve:
	▪	Credit assignment
	•	Need to know which actions were responsible for the outcome
 
	◦	Standard:
	•	Create an evaluation fn
	▪	Easy: Win/lose game, take/lose piece, move away from sides when board shrinks
	▪	Hard: What are good moves that don't involve this? - Reduces the amount of moves the enemy can do, near a friendly piece protecting them
 
	•	Use minimax
 
 
Wanna do weekly meetings?
	•	Basically any day works for me
	•	I have my AI tute from 9-11 on Friday, how's 11 onwards sound, that way I can ask my tutor some Qs after the tute.
 
For weekly meetings:
	•	Work in our own time, then meet up on <day> to compare, chat about what we have been doing and how we're going to implement the next part.
	•	If somewhat completed, run the code, play against previous versions, record any progress
 
Planning around assignments:
 
Chris:
	•	SWEN: Ass2 29th Apr
	•	ML Stage 1: 9 May, Wed
