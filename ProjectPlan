Sharing the load:
	• Using github to constantly update where we are up to
	• Set a new set of tasks weekly. Dividing the work up into different modules to allow us to work simultaneously.
	• For this week, we will be looking at how to approach the problem
	• Currently ML sounds promising and extremely interesting.
		○ Our approach will use unsupervised learning, and we will be looking at how to assign credit
		○ Taking a greater look at TensorFlow and how it could be used for this situation
		
				

Keeping in touch:
	• Most of the work will of course be done in our own time. 
	• We will be meeting weekly after the AI tute from 11 onwards.  We are both free for the rest of the day, allowing us to both meet and continue working on aspects of the project. 
	• We have each other on facebook and have been, and will continue to communicate how we're going over fb.
